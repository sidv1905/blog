# <a name="Why">Why do we need this ?</a>

JavaScript is wild. It gives you a hundred ways to do the same thing—and somehow, they're all valid. When we need to manipulate a value in multiple ways, the usual route is to write separate methods and call them one after another. But JavaScript leans in and says, "Relax, buddy. I got you." Instead of calling each method individually, JavaScript lets you chain them together like a boss, running one after the other in a single, elegant line.

Yes, JavaScript is that cool.

Let’s say you have a <span>Player</span> instance. Now you want to set the player's salary, update it later, change their team, and then—after the team change—add a bonus to their salary. Normally, you'd write a class with different methods for each of these actions and call them step by step.

But with method chaining, you can do it all in one go, like a fluent conversation with your code. It's not just efficient—it’s stylish.

Let's look at old school method here:

```js
player.setSalary(100);

player.changeTeam('Barcelona');

player.addBonus(100);

player.getDetails();
```

JavaScript be like, "Whoa, that's a lot of lines. Ever heard of method chaining? Trust me, it's just better."

And once you implement it, life gets good. Now you can:

```js
player.setSalary(1000)
.changeTeam('Barcelona')
.addBonus(100)
.getDetails();
```

First, the longer way is like this:  
We call the player to set his salary—he says “okay” and goes back home. Then we call him again like, “Hey, by the way, we changed your team.”

Now, it’s obviously not *literally* that, but you get the point—it's a bunch of unnecessary lines of code.

And here's another fun use case:  
What if we have a *hugeee* function? A chaotic mess. Instead of crying over it, we can break it into smaller, meaningful pieces and call them just like we did above.  
Isn’t that amazing?

So yeah—better readability, more concise code, improved reusability, and overall, just a good practice to follow.

# What can be done?

There are three ways to approach this. It really depends on your preferred design pattern and personal coding style. So, take a moment and think about it.

How can we solve this?  
What JavaScript feature can we take advantage of?

If we think it through, what we need is a technique where, when we call `player.setSalary(100)`, it updates the player’s internal state *and* returns a reference to the same object—so we can immediately call the next method, like `.changeTeam("Lakers")`.

So how do we reference the same object within its own methods?

Say hello to the magic word: `this`

`this` in JavaScript refers to the object that is currently calling the function. So when we invoke a method, we can “self-reference” the object and return it, allowing us to chain the next method. Isn’t that cool?

Just imagine an object with a value and a bunch of methods. When we call one of those methods, it returns `this`—i.e., a reference to itself—so the next function gets that and continues operating on the same object with a fresh invocation.

**That’s the trick. That’s how it works.

# Solution:

Now let’s look at the simplest method to implement this:

Just a plain ol' object.

Let’s imagine we have object1.

This object uses this, and returns this.  
LOL—confused?

Let’s back it up:  
Do you know what this in JavaScript is?

If not, refer here:  
**Read about this here:** [Mozilla MDN: this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)

Now that you know what `this` does and how it behaves—in simple terms, it refers to *itself*.  
That is, the object on which the method is being called. You see `player.` , so the one before the dot (`.`) is what `this` refers to inside the method.

**And that, my friend, is the core of method chaining.**

In our object’s methods, we simply `return this`.

That’s basically saying, *“Here, take this object back so you can call another method on it.”*  
And that’s how, as we manipulate the object, we keep returning `this`, allowing us to chain even more calls—on the same object, clean and neat.

# How to write it?

Now we’ll explore the **three major ways** to implement method chaining.

These are just design patterns, and they rely on core JavaScript concepts like prototypes, functions, and class syntax—so make sure you're comfortable with those before jumping in.

So go ahead, learn those, then come back.

First up:

## 1. Simply Object

```js
let player = {
  salary: 0,
  team: 'Chelsea',
  setSalary(CTC) {
    this.salary = CTC;
    return this;
  },
  changeTeam(Team) {
    this.team = Team;
    return this;
  },
  addBonus(money) {
    this.salary += money;
    return this;
  },
  getDetails() {
    console.log(`This Player now gets ${this.salary} playing for ${this.team}`);
  },
};

player.setSalary(1000).changeTeam('Barcelona').addBonus(100).getDetails();
```




`player.setSalary(100)` is called first—simple, right? Basic JavaScript.

But take a look inside the function: it returns `this`.  
And `this` is pointing to the same object.

So now,  
`player.setSalary(100)` returns the reference to the `player` object.

Which means...

I have the same object in hand—I can now do  
`return this.changeTeam("barcelona")`, right?

And since that also returns `this`, I can chain even more methods after that.

**That’s the foundation of how method chaining works in JavaScript.**

### Limitation:  
We can’t directly create multiple instances this way (unless we start duplicating objects manually or redesign it to support that).

---

Another syntactic method is using **Functions**:

## 2. Functions

```js
function Player() {}

Player.prototype.salary = 0;
Player.prototype.team = 'Chelsea';

Player.prototype.setSalary = function (CTC) {
  this.salary = CTC;
  return this;
};

Player.prototype.changeTeam = function (Team) {
  this.team = Team;
  return this;
};

Player.prototype.addBonus = function (Money) {
  this.salary += Money;
  return this;
};

Player.prototype.getDetails = function () {
  console.log(`This Player now gets ${this.salary} playing for ${this.team}`);
  return this;
};
```

Now, how do we make an object of it?

Just do:

```js
const player1 = new Player()

player1.changeTeam("Manu").setSalary(1000).addBonus(100)
```

There’s no major difference in functionality here.

Just imagine—or better yet, read—what the new keyword actually does.
It creates an object and returns it. We can then refer to that object using the this keyword.

So basically, we’re storing a plain empty JavaScript object in player1, and we can refer to it because it comes before the dot.
Yes—the dot! The thing before the dot gives us the context of what we want to change.

It’s JavaScript’s two simple-yet-complex concepts haunting us and helping us at the same time.

## 3. Classes
It’s simpler to understand if you’re already familiar with prototypes—because behind the scenes, classes work the same way.
They’re just a different, more modern way to write and share properties and behavior.


```js
class PlayerClass {
  team = 'Chelsea';
  salary = 0;

  setSalary(CTC) {
    this.salary = CTC;
    return this;
  }
  changeTeam(Team) {
    this.team = Team;
    return this;
  }
  addBonus(money) {
    this.salary += money;
    return this;
  }
  getDetails() {
    console.log(
      `This Player Class now gets ${this.salary} playing for ${this.team}`,
    );
  }
}
```

Now we can create simple objects with the new keyword—that’s the main advantage of classes. At least when it comes to method chaining, nothing else really changes.
const player3 = new PlayerClass();
```js
player3.setSalary(1000).changeTeam("real madrid").getDetails();

const player4 = new PlayerClass();


player4.setSalary(200).addBonus(100).changeTeam("Manu").getDetails();
```


See? That’s how amazing method chaining is.


To me, method chaining looks cleaner and more intuitive than currying. It’s just a neat way of structuring objects to enable clear, single-line method calls that flow naturally.

That said—method chaining isn’t always the right answer. You can’t chain everything all the time. Too much chaining can actually hurt code readability.

What if one of the methods returning this throws an exception?
What if you want to change the behavior of a method in the middle of a chain?
Could that break the rest of the chain?

Think about these points carefully and make a wise decision.

Personally, I mostly use method chaining for updating user data or modifying objects sequentially—where it really shines in improving readability and flow.
